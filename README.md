### About my technical hobbies
* **Bug Bounty**: I hunt and chain bugs in a flow 100% hands-on, wandering on public and private programs of HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, Zerocopter and others.
* **Malware Development**: I code malware using Go and C#. Focus: sandbox detection/evasion, persistence, exfiltration, and C2 untraceability. Just for educational purposes ‚úåÔ∏è 
* **Hacking Tools**: Python is my favorite programming language for exploit development and scripting. I can spend a lot of hours programming... ü§ñüêç
